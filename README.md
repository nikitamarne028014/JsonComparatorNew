Json-Comparator is a java code to compare 2 json Files.The purpose of this comparator is to check if both the files are similar or not and to list down the differences between them very easily. In this code when you import the project you need to change the file locations to the file locations of your own local machine.

there are 3 files present in the code

leftJson.Json (First File to compare)
rightJson.Json (second File to compare)
Json_Comparision_Output. (This file will give the detail report of the comparision between 2 json files. The result of the comparision is written in this file)

Note - 
 1. Before running the code please change the file paths as per your computer location.
 2. If you want to try using different Json Files just add it to the path.
